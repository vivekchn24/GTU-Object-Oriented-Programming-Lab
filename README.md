# ☕ Java Practical Programs – GTU Semester 7

This repository contains basic Java programs created as part of practical exercises for core programming logic development. The programs demonstrate operations like sorting, searching, character checking, recursion, array processing, GCD, and more — suitable for beginners or GTU students.

## 📚 Subject Information

- **Semester**: 7  
- **University**: Gujarat Technological University (GTU)  
- **Student**: Vivek Chauhan

## ✅ Programs Included

### 🔸 `Pr5.java` – Sort Three Numbers in Decreasing Order  
- Takes three integers from the user and sorts them in decreasing order using conditional swaps.

--->>

### 🔸 `Pr6.java` – Vowel or Consonant Checker  
- Accepts a character input and determines if it's a vowel or consonant.  
⚠️ *Note: Logic needs improvement for consonant case detection.*

---

### 🔸 `Pr8.java` – GCD Calculation (Euclidean Algorithm)  
- Calculates the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers using subtraction-based Euclidean method.

---

### 🔸 `Pr9.java` – Duplicate of Pr8.java  
- Same functionality as `Pr8.java` (likely a mistaken copy-paste).

--->>

### 🔸 `Pr10.java` – Array Reverse Attempt  
- Tries to read 10 integers into an array and reverse them.  
⚠️ *Note: The current implementation has syntax & logic issues (e.g., undeclared variable `n`, invalid loop).*

--->>

### 🔸 `Pr11.java` – 2D Array Initialization and Display  
- Initializes a 6×6 2D array and prints all its elements.  
- Default values will be `0` since no input is taken.

--->>

### 🔸 `practical4.java` – BMI Unit Conversion (Incorrect Formula)  
- Converts user’s weight from kg to pounds and height from meters to inches.  
⚠️ *Note: Multiplication values are incorrect (`45359237` and `0254`), should be `2.20462` and `39.3701` respectively.*

--->>

### 🔸 `comparethreevalues.java`  
- **[File content not shared]** — please ensure the logic is complete and matches naming conventions.
